- gradient color background
- the scene is macos screen

the macos screen is white, so the text should be white, and it should be typing text

- font should be code font
  <!-- - text on the screen appears: "Can you guess what's wrong with the following code?" -->
  <!--   As the text is being typed, the camera should move from left to right as the text is appearing. -->
  <!--   in the end the camera should zoom out to show the entire scene. -->

The code appears on the screen and we zoom into the code.

The code is:

```python
def foo(value, a= []):
  return a.append(value)
```

Then the code moves to the left top corner.

Voiceover: "No, what happens when I execute that function?"

```python
foo(1)
```

"What happens if I except that function?"

```python
foo(3)
```

Can you guess what will be the output? Is it [3] or [1, 3]?
